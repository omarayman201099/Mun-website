    <h2>LETTER FROM MUN NEW CAIRO</h2>

    <p>
  Dear Delegates and Faculty Advisors,
The process of performing something faultless for the first time tends to be tough to accomplish.
Nevertheless, repeating the process again with the same faultless pattern is utterly harsh. Regardless, we
possess determinant intentions to yield a completely new favorable experience for STEM Model United
Nations. Our former generation started the journey with an unexpected level of proficiency. Now, STEM MUN
will prove that the legacy is within safe keepers.
Along the season, delegates will enjoy a memorable experience for MUN, which is renowned for the fun in it,
rather than boredom. Our academics committee are exposing the extent of their efforts to deliver the
information in a smooth manner. Throughout the multiple sessions, the elected delegates will acquire plenty
of helpful information. This information will enable them to engage in fruitful debates which impacts in
considering every potential resolution. At the end, a well-established memory of us will be dug deep-down in
each one's mind for good.

    </p>
